# Bubble Turtle Adventure
This is a game built on the unity game engine as part of a game design class. The final result of this team effort allows players to play as a cute turtle, walking a lone road full of killer bees.
You can play the game by choosing one of the options in the `Release` file. The easiest format for most is the browser-based via firefox.
- Sprites were designed and animated by the team, except for the bee enemies and different weapons which were open-source spritesheets online.
- All music/sounds except for the main level background music is original score by the team
- All background design elements/images are original by the team.
- All code, of course, was written by the team.
